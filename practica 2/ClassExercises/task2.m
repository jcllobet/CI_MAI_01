%Objective: Analyze the change in the output of a single neuron when changing the weight, the
%bias and the transfer function.

%% 1)Run demo nnd2n1

nnd2n1; %undo comment to see the output

%% 2) Study how the different values of weight, bias, transfer function and input p modify
%the output of the neuron
