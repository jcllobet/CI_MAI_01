%% Task 4 â€“ Changing the number of neurons

%Objective: Analyse the change in the number of neurons in the hidden layer. 
% How increasing of hidden layer neurons affects to function approximation?
% ANSWER: Better approximation of the given points (since we're in
% trainning)
% Are there any side-effects if number of hidden layer neurons is high?
% ANSWER: OVERFITTING & higher computational costs !!

% TODO: Review & Research answers in more detail
